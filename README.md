## Roles

A — 3D Preprocessing & Geometry Engineer      ← Alfred
B — Global Landmark Model Engineer            ← Ojas
C — Validation & Geometric Refinement Engineer - Pravi
D — Inference & Pipeline Engineer - Ayush

## Role A — 3D preprocessing & geometry (COMPLETE)

Owner: Alfred. Handover: `docs/HANDOFF_A.md` (frozen signatures, npz schema, all
numbers). Verified data facts: `DATA_SPEC.md`. Status: `docs/STATUS_A.md`.

**What Role A provides.** Raw Huawei head PLY -> left/right `CanonicalEar`: 2048
canonical-frame points per ear plus an exactly invertible `EarTransform` back to
Huawei coordinates. Concretely: mesh/annotation loaders (`src/data.py`), the frozen
ear crop, canonical transform, inverse and sampler (`src/geometry.py`), the processed
`.npz` cache reader/writer (`src/cache.py`), the frozen crop box (`configs/crop.yaml`)
and the provisional 160/40 subject split (`splits/`). Every transform is derived from
the **mesh and the frozen config only** — ground-truth landmarks are never allowed to
define a crop, centre, scale, rotation or mirror.

**The five verification scripts, and what each proves.**

| script | what it proves |
|---|---|
| `scripts/inspect_dataset.py` | the data conventions themselves — units, file layout, subject IDs, PLY properties (no stored normals), the 85-line `<idx>,[<x> <y> <z>]` annotation layout, and the +Y = subject's-left sign. Aggregates only; never dumps points. |
| `scripts/crop_stats.py` | that a crop box derived from the **training** subjects generalises. Its freeze criterion is **leave-one-out**: every subject is measured against a box rebuilt without it, and the minimum headroom must be > 0 on every axis, both sides. It writes `crop.rejected.yaml` and exits 1 if that fails. |
| `scripts/check_crop_all.py` | that the frozen box still keeps **85/85** GT landmarks inside on subjects it was *not* derived from. Exit 1 on any truncated ear or suspicious crop. This is the real generalisation test; the leave-one-out headroom only estimates it. |
| `scripts/check_roundtrip.py` | that the transform is **exactly invertible**. Builds it from the mesh alone, pushes GT landmarks to canonical and back through `EarTransform.from_dict(to_dict())` — the same path Role D's predictions take — and exits 1 above 1e-9 mm. Also reports the canonical envelope Role C sizes the template with. |
| `scripts/check_mirror.py` | the **mirror convention**: each subject's own two canonical ears compared under no-mirror / mirror-right / mirror-left, rebuilt from the mesh every time (the cache is never read). Decides mirror vs no mirror, and its per-contour spread shows whether left and right index the landmarks the same way. Changes no default — it reports. |

`scripts/preprocess.py` (cache build), `scripts/make_split.py` (split) and
`scripts/plot_ear.py` (QA figures) are build/inspection tools, not checks.

**Reproduce cache and checks from a fresh clone.** Needs the NDA dataset locally
(folders `mesh/` and `landmarks/`); nothing under the data root is ever committed.

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install numpy trimesh pyyaml matplotlib pytest    # no requirements.txt yet
$env:HUAWEI_DATA_ROOT = "<path containing mesh/ and landmarks/>"

pytest tests -q                                        # 169 passed, synthetic data only

# 1. data conventions (all 200 meshes)
python scripts/inspect_dataset.py --max-meshes 0

# 2. crop box — DO NOT re-run these unless the split actually changes.
#    splits/ and configs/crop.yaml are COMMITTED. crop_stats.py stamps a
#    `generated:` timestamp into crop.yaml, so a re-run produces a file with a
#    DIFFERENT sha256 even when the bounds are identical — and every cached ear
#    stores that sha256, so the next preprocess.py run would declare all 400
#    files stale and fail. To verify the committed box without touching it:
python scripts/crop_stats.py --subject-list splits/train_ids.txt --dry-run

# 3. the three checks
python scripts/check_roundtrip.py --subject-list splits/val_ids.txt
python scripts/check_crop_all.py  --subject-list splits/val_ids.txt
python scripts/check_mirror.py    --subject-list splits/train_ids.txt --limit 40

# 4. build the processed cache (cache/<subject_id>_<side>.npz, git-ignored)
python scripts/preprocess.py --subject-list splits/train_ids.txt --with-targets
python scripts/preprocess.py --subject-list splits/val_ids.txt   --with-targets
```

`check_roundtrip.py`, `check_crop_all.py`, `crop_stats.py` and `preprocess.py`
exit non-zero on failure, so they can be run as a gate. **`check_mirror.py` is the
exception: it reports and exits 0 even when the current default loses** — it is
deliberately not allowed to change a frozen setting, so read its verdict block.

If the split ever changes, the order is fixed: regenerate `configs/crop.yaml`
first, then re-run the checks, then rebuild the cache with `--overwrite`.

B and C read the cache **only** through `src.cache.load_cached_ear` / `list_cached`
— never by parsing npz keys directly.

## Important

Huawei NDA-protected data must not be committed to this repository.

The implementation objective is to establish a complete end-to-end
PLY → left/right 85×3 landmark pipeline before adding optional features.
